# Goal: Sort stack so that they are in order from largest (at bottom) --> smallest (at top)
# Actions:  Stick spatula into stack and flip all pancakes above it
# I.e. [3 1 2 5 4] --> [2 1 3 5 4]  (flip between 2 and 5)
#
# BURNT pancake problem:  Distinguish between top and bottom of pancakes (bottoms burnt)
# ID bottom of pancakes with a negative number
# I.e  [3 -1 2 5 4] --> the -1 size pancake has burnt side up
# Flipping between 2 and 5 again, we get:  [3 -1 2 5 4] --> [-2 1 -3 5 4]
#    - Basically, change sign for everything the flipping range

# Read from .config
# Line 1 --> Keyword pancakes, tells us it's the pancake problem
# Line 2 --> Init state i.e. (3, -1, 2, 5, 4)
# Line 3 --> Goal state i.e. (1,2,3,4,5)

# So, transition state are:
# - for every elem in pancakes tuple, reverse the the sublist up until that point,
#   and flip sign of every element in it... takes a minute
