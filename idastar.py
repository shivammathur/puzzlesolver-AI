# Think: Iterative deepening, but instead of depth, use the weights in our PQ... or cost...
#        May need to make another field in the Node class that holds the previous heuristic value? Hmm.
#        Or do we deepen on actual cost? Need to read book.

# If we reach max cost, but there are child nodes left to explore --->
#   use children nodes' value to inform how much we increase depth on next traversal
#      In checking bool, set nextMin.... which=value of the child node's pathcost.....
#      nextMin is lowest of child nodes values...
